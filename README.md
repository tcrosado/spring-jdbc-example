# spring-jdbc-example

After strugling a bit  over spring jdbc interface i ended up following the [tutorialspoint article on the matter](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/spring_jdbc_example.htm) with great success.
The first code posted here is basicaly a copy of the code in that article plus the configurations needed over Maven.


Later i added a REST interface to this spring application to check how the rest api creation works on spring framework.
